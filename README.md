# corewar

First year Epitech project where you create programs, called champions, that fight. The project is split in 2 parts: an assembler and a virtual machine to run an arena, where programs fight.

## Compilation

```c
make
```

## Usage

```
./asm <champion to compile>
./corewar [-visual] [-n] <champions>
```

written champion files ends with the "s" extension.
compiled champion files ends with the "cor" extension.

- `-visual` enables a 2D visualization of the arena.
- `-n <number>` add `number` players
- `champions` compiled champions to fight with.
